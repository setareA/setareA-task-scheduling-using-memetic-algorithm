##project description
We have a number of computing centers that each center has a computational cluster.
Each computational cluster consists of a number of nodes with the same resources.
On the other side, we have a number of processing programs. Each program requires a certain amount of core processing and memory. 
We need to distribute these programs to existing computing centers.
